map_delete(3)         LPC 系统函数         map_delete(3)

名称
     map_delete() - remove a (key, value)  pair  from  a  mapping
     based on the key

语法
     void map_delete( mapping m, mixed element );

描述
     map_delete removes the (key, value) from the mapping m  that
     has key equal to element.

     For example, given:

          mapping names;

          names = ([]);
          names["truilkan"] = "john";
          names["wayfarer"] = "erik";
          names["jacques"] = "dwayne";

     Then:

          map_delete(names,"truilkan");

     causes the mapping 'names' to be equal to:

          (["wayfarer" : "erik", "jacques" : "dwayne"])

     keys(names)    will    not    contain    "truilkan"    after
     map_delete(names,"truilkan")  is called [unless ("truilkan",
     *) is subsequently added back to the mapping].
