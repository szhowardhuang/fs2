名称
     function_profile() - get function profiling information  for
     an object

语法
     mixed *function_profile( object ob );

描述
     Returns  function  profiling  information   for   `ob',   or
     this_object() if `ob' is not specified.  This is only avail-
     able if  the  driver  was  compiled  with  PROFILE_FUNCTIONS
     defined.

RETURN VALUE
     An array of mappings is returned, one for each  function  in
     `ob', the format of the mapping is:
            ([ "name"     : name_of_the_function,
               "calls"    : number_of_calls,

               /* cpu time expressed in microseconds */
               "self"     : cpu_time_spent_in self,
               "children" : cpu_time_spent_in_children
            ])
     The usefulness of this is tied to the resolution of the  CPU
     clock--even though the units are microseconds, the CPU timer
     resolution is often much less
