read_bytes(3)         LPC 系统函数         read_bytes(3)

名称
     read_bytes() - reads a contiguous series  of  bytes  from  a
     file into a string

语法
     string read_bytes( string path, int start, int length );

描述
     This function reads  'length'  bytes  beginning  at  byte  #
     'start' in the file named 'path'.  The bytes are returned as
     a string.  Note that (start + length) must not be  past  the
     end of the file or else read_bytes will fail.  If the second
     and  third  arguments  are  omitted,  the  entire  file   is
     returned.
