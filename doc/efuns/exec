exec(3)               LPC 系统函数               exec(3)

名称
     exec() - switches a player (interactive) connection from one
     object to another

语法
     int exec( object to, object from );

描述
     This efunction allows the interactive link to a given object
     to be migrated to another object.  That is, after a success-
     ful exec(to, from) call, interactive(to) will return  1  and
     interactive(from)  will  return 0.  The player that was con-
     trolling 'from' will begin controlling  'to'  following  the
     exec()  call.  Note that this is a powerful function and its
     use must be restricted if you wish  to  attempt  to  have  a
     secure mud.  The proper way to restrict the use of exec() is
     to  make  a  simul_efun  of  the  same  name  and  then  use
     valid_override(4)  to restrict the use of a simul_efun over-
     ride (i.e. efun::exec()).  The exec() function returns 1  if
     the switch is successful (and 0 otherwise).

请参考
     interactive(3), valid_override(4)
