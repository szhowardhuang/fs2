get_char(3)           LPC 系统函数           get_char(3)

名称
     get_char - causes next character of input to be  sent  to  a
     specified function

语法
     varargs void get_char( string | function fun, int flag,  ...
     );

描述
     Enable next character of user input to be sent to the  func-
     tion  `fun'  as an argument. The input character will not be
     parsed by the driver.

     Note that get_char is  non-blocking  which  means  that  the
     object  calling  get_char  does not pause waiting for input.
     Instead the object continues to execute any statements  fol-
     lowing  the get_char.  The specified function `fun' will not
     be called until the user input has been collected.

     If "get_char()" is called more than once in the same  execu-
     tion, only the first call has any effect.

     If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the char  given  by
     the  player  will  not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped
     (this is useful for collecting passwords).

     The function `fun' will be called with the user input as its
     first argument (a string). Any additional arguments supplied
     to get_char will be passed on to `fun' as arguments  follow-
     ing the user input.

BUGS
     Please note that get_char has a significant bug in MudOS 0.9
     and  earlier.   On many systems with poor telnet negotiation
     (read:  almost  every  major  workstation  on  the  market),
     get_char  makes  screen  output behave strangely.  It is not
     recommended for common usage  throughout  the  mudlib  until
     that bug is fixed.  (It is currently only known to work well
     for users connecting from NeXT computers.)
